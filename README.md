## :crossed_swords: Executive Summary & Motivation :crossed_swords:

:zap: Superheroes or Villains? DC or Marvel? What does the data say about superheroes? What are the trends in our superheroes and our villains? The motivation for analyzing the world of superheroes was born out of the lack of understanding them. Superheroes are part of a massive and encompassing universe that I personally never had much interest in persuing. I wanted to know why. I began as I always do, asking questions; I asked a few of the biggest comic fans I know, why do you like superheroes? The answers varied. What I started to understand was how little I was represented in superheroes. Who are our superheroes actually for? Who are our heroes representing? What does the data tell us about representation in our superheroes? <br>

## Data Question <br>
<br>
:crossed_swords: Who is being represented as a hero? Has this changed over time? It only takes one question into a search engine to begin to see problem start to emerge. Straight, white, males aren't the only ones who can save women (and the world too.) When we limit representation in our media we put people into smaller boxes. If our heroes are meant to reflect the best in us, then they shold reflect the best in all of us, right? Let's see that the data says.

:exclamation: The API is not large enough to paint a comprehensive picture, however it does provide a starting point. The data was not cleaned therefore this will take the most amount of time.
